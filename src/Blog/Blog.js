                <p>React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.
                    Let us create a simple application to React to understand how the React Router works. The application will contain three components: home component, about a component, and contact component. We will use React Router to navigate between these components.</p>

                <hr className='mb-4' />
                <p>useRef persists(store) values between renders BUT it does not re-render the component by any chance. Even when the initial value stored in a useRef is updated, useRef will not render the component and if peradventure another function causes the component to re-render, the reference value is persisted(stored). However, in the case of useState, any change in persisted data will cause the component to re-render.

                    useRef and useState hook also have different syntaxes:

                    const reference = useRef(initialValue);
                    The useRef hook is mutable, it returns a mutable ref object, so initialValue can be updated without it affecting the React lifecycle.

                    const [value, setValue] = useState();
                    The useState hook, on the other hand, is a reactive hook, it returns the value and a setValue function that is then used to update the state, the actions cause changes in the React lifecycle thereby causing the component to re-render.

                    To further drive home these points, letâ€™s consider a simple example.

                    Example: Build a basic React application that shows the number of times a component renders on the screen.</p>
